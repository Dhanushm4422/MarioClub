      <h2>It's me, Mario</h2>
      <p>Meet Mario, the mustached hero of the Mushroom Kingdom.<br>
         You may know him as a famous plumber, but he's also
        kart racer, sports star, caped hero, and more! Using 
        all his amazing abilities, he works with his friends
         to keep the Mushroom Kingdom safe.</p>
      <p>Story (from the original instruction booklet)<br>
        One day the kingdom of the peaceful mushroom people was invaded by the Koopa,
         a tribe of turtles famous for their black magic. 
        The quiet, peace-loving Mushroom People were turned into mere stones, 
        bricks and even field horsehair plants, and the Mushroom Kingdom fell into ruin.
        The only one who can undo the magic spell on the Mushroom People and return them to 
        their normal selves is the Princess Toadstool, the daughter of the Mushroom King.
         Unfortunately, she is presently in the hands of Bowser, the King of the Koopa.
        Mario hears about the Mushroom People's plight and sets out on a quest to free
         the Mushroom Princess from the evil Koopa and restore the fallen kingdom of the Mushroom People.
        You are Mario! It's up to you to save the Mushroom People from the black magic of the Koopa!</p>
